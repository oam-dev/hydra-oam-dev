A simple static site: [oam.dev](https://oam.dev/)
Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and Github Pages.

## Important Note: Master Branch 

The `master` branch is the public-facing production build of the Github Pages website [oam-dev.github.io](https://oam-dev.github.io/).

Hence, the `master` branch is off limits for any development work.
PRs should be opened against the `dev` branch.


## Development

The site uses a custom theme, based off of the Fresh theme for Hugo by Luc Perkins. The underlying CSS framework is bulma, [docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/) are here. Any changes to the CSS/SCSS need to be rebuilt and commited to update the site appearance.

```
// run hugo to have the pipes rebuild and recompile
# hugo

// make sure to commit the generated results to git
# git add resources/*
```


## Deployment 

Deploying a Hugo site to Github Pages is a little tricky, there are some common options.

* [Using a two repository method](https://github.com/whipperstacker/blog/blob/master/content/post/deploying-a-hugo-site-to-github-pages.md) where one is the source and one is the dist.
* [Using a deploy script](https://github.com/sglyon/hugo_gh_blog/blob/master/deploy.sh) to push the /public folder to the prod branch

This site currently uses the latter method. To deploy the site:

1. Switch to the dev branch
2. Run the script `bash ./deploy.sh` 

This will recompile the  hugo site, and then push the content to github (origin > master), overwriting the previous build.
